# GKraken
GKraken is a GTK application that allows you to control the cooling
(and soon also the lighting) of a NZXT Kraken X (X42, X52, X62 or X72) 
pump from Linux.

## Project in Maintenance mode
<img src="/art/gkraken.png" width="128" align="right" hspace="0" />

This project is now in maintenance mode. I am not planning to develop any new feature nor to support
any new Kraken device. I also don't own a NZXT Kraken anymore so I am unable to test GKraken myself.
If you want to help with the testing, please join the discord server of the project: https://discord.gg/Q33n3UC.

## üì¶ How to get GKraken
### Install from Flathub
This is the preferred way to get GKraken on any major distribution (Arch, Fedora, Linux Mint, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc).

If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

#### Install
```bash
flatpak --user install flathub com.leinardi.gkraken
```

#### Run
```bash
flatpak run com.leinardi.gkraken
```

### Install from source code

plus all the Python dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

#### Clone project and install
If you have not installed GKraken yet:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gkraken.git
cd gkraken
git checkout release
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
sudo ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Update old installation
If you installed GKraken from source code previously and you want to update it:
```bash
cd gkraken
git fetch
git checkout release
git reset --hard origin/release
git submodule init
git submodule update
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
sudo ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Run
Once installed, to start it you can simply execute on a terminal:
```bash
gkraken
```

## Running the app
To start the app you have to run the command `gkraken` in a terminal. The app needs to access the USB interface of the Kraken that, normally,
is not available to unprivileged users. 

To allow normal users to access the Kraken's USB interface you can 
create a custom udev rule

### Adding Udev rule
#### Using GKraken
Simply run:
```bash
gkraken --add-udev-rule
```
It will automatically refresh also the udev rules.

#### Manually
Create a new file in `/lib/udev/rules.d/60-gkraken.rules` containing this text:
```bash
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1e71", ATTRS{idProduct}=="170e", MODE="0666"
```

After that, run the following commands
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb --attr-match=idVendor=1e71 --action=add
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Build, install and run with Flatpak
If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gkraken.git
```
It is possible to build the local source or the remote one (the same that Flathub uses)
### Local repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-local --flatpak-install
```
### Remote repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-remote --flatpak-install
```
### Run
```bash
flatpak run com.leinardi.gkraken --debug
```

## ‚ùì FAQ
### The Flatpak version of GKraken is not using my theme, how can I fix it?
To fix this issue install a Gtk theme from Flathub. This way, Flatpak applications will automatically pick the 
installed Gtk theme and use that instead of Adwaita.

Use this command to get a list of all the available Gtk themes on Flathub:
```bash
flatpak --user remote-ls flathub | grep org.gtk.Gtk3theme
```
And then just install your preferred theme. For example, to install Yaru:
```
flatpak install flathub org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Yaru
``````

### Where are the settings and profiles stored on the filesystem?
| Installation type |                     Location                     |
|-------------------|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Flatpak           |        `$HOME/.var/app/com.leinardi.gkraken/`        |
| Source code       | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `$HOME/.config/gkraken`) |

## üíö How to help the project
### Discord server
If you want to help testing or developing it would be easier to get in touch using the Discord server of the project: https://discord.gg/Q33n3UC  
Just write a message on the general channel saying how you want to help (test, dev, etc) and quoting @leinardi. If you don't use discor but still want to help just open a new issue here.

### Can I support this project some other way?

Something simple that everyone can do is to star it on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gkraken) and [GitHub](https://github.com/leinardi/gkraken).
Feedback is always welcome: if you found a bug or would like to suggest a feature,
feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gkraken/issues).

## ‚ö† Dropped PyPI support
Production builds were previously distributed using PyPI. This way of distributing the software is simple
but requires the user to manually install all the non Python dependencies like cairo, glib, appindicator3, etc.  
A solution for all this problems is distributing the app via Flatpak, since with it all the dependencies
will be bundled and provided automatically, making possible to use new GTK features also on distributions
using an older version of Gnome.

**No new build will be published on PyPI**.

### Uninstall pip version
If you have already installed GKraken via `pip`, please make sure to uninstall it completely before moving to a newer version:

```bash
pip3 uninstall gkraken
rm -rf ~/.config/gkraken
```
